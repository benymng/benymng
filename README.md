### Hi there ðŸ˜ƒ

My name is Ben and I am a grade 12 student from Calgary, Alberta!

I am primarily interested in full stack web development and data science with a focus on Python, React, ExpressJS, NodeJS, TailwindCSS and C.

I have completed CS50, won the PTC Hack Your Tomorrow Hackathon, and achieved Best Environmental Hack at Bridgehacks Hackathon.
